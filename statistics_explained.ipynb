The mean would be heavily skewed by the millionaire, pulling the average up to a point that doesnâ€™t represent most people's earnings. On the other hand, the median would simply be one of the $40,000 incomes, giving a much clearer picture of what the \"typical\" person in that group earns. This is why the median often gives a more realistic sense of central tendency when extreme values are present."
